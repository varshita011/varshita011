Hi there,

I'm Varshitha Puchakayal, Senior Software Developer with over 4 years of dedicated expertise in Java J2EE technologies. My career journey has been defined by a diverse range of experiences, spanning UI development, middleware solutions, cloud computing, and database management.

In the realm of User Interface development, I've honed my skills in Angular (6 and 10), TypeScript, ReactJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ajax, and jQuery. Crafting dynamic and user-friendly interfaces has always been a passion of mine.

On the backend, I've cultivated proficiency in Java Servlets, Spring, EJB, JPA, JDBC, and Web Services. My goal has always been to build robust and efficient server-side applications.

Embracing the cloud era, I've navigated the intricacies of AWS and Kubernetes, harnessing the power of cloud technologies to optimize system performance and scalability.

When it comes to databases, I'm well-versed in both relational and non-relational database systems. In the realm of relational databases, I've worked extensively with Oracle, SQL, MySQL, and Postgres. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with non-relational databases like MongoDB and Cassandra.




My passion for technology and my dedication to staying current with industry trends have been the driving forces behind my successful career. I'm excited to connect with fellow professionals, share insights, and explore new opportunities in the dynamic world of software development
